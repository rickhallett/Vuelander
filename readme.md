## Why Am I doing this?
### Encouragement for the hard times

1. Because new tools, new languages and shiny toys, whilst fun, never really improve my raw ability as a programmer.
2. Because, generally in life, doing really hard shit is the fastest way to get somewhere amazing.
3. Because tutorial land only ever takes you so far.
4. To get away from build steps, tooling, configuration and the endless 'churn' of the world of software.
5. This is just me and the code.
6. Because learning to read the work of great engineers is the best example we have how to do things properly.
7. Because its only by studying a really complex system that you can actually understand how really complex systems work.
8. Because learning to wield the debugger when you have more code than you can read is one of the most valuable skills a programmer can have.
